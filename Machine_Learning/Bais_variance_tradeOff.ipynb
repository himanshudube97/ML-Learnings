    "The **bias-variance trade-off** is a fundamental concept in machine learning that describes the balance between two sources of error in predictive models: **bias** and **variance**. Achieving a good balance is key to building models that generalize well to new, unseen data.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the context of data analysis and machine learning, **linear data** and **non-linear data** refer to the type of relationship that exists between the input variables (features) and the output variable (target).
